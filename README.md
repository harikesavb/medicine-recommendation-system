# Medical Recommendation System ðŸ©º

This repository contains the implementation of a Disease Prediction and Medical Recommendation System developed for the CS 584 Machine Learning course.

## Introduction
The Medical Recommendation System leverages machine learning techniques to predict diseases based on user-entered symptoms. It provides recommendations for medications, diets, and workouts tailored to specific diseases. The project uses a dataset from Kaggle comprising symptoms, diseases, medications, and other medical attributes to train and evaluate machine learning models.


###  Datasets
- `description.csv`: Descriptions of diseases.
- `diets.csv`: Recommended diets for diseases.
- `medications.csv`: Medications prescribed for diseases.
- `precautions_df.csv`: Precautions to be taken for diseases.
- `Symptom-severity.csv`: Severity of symptoms.
- `symptoms_df.csv`: Symptoms with corresponding disease labels.
- `Training.csv`: Dataset for training machine learning models.
- `workout_df.csv`: Recommended workouts for diseases.



## Project Files Overview
- `main.py`: Entry point for the Flask web application.
- `disease_prediction_system.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing and model training.
- `index.html`: Front-end interface for the web application.
